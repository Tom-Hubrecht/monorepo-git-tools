v1.0.1
- minor minification of git-split

v1.0.0
- adds feature: `git split out`. Takes a local repository and splits out portions of it into a new branch and rewrites history as if those portions are the only thing in the repository.
- adds feature: `git split in`. Takes a remote repository and adds it to your local repository as a new branch. Then rewrites the history on that branch to rename portions of the remote repository to match your local one.
